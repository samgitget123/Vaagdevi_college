            <p>The Department of Botany, one of the oldest departments, steadily progressed and the laboratory facilities were highly expanded for the benefit of students and practical knowledge. The main aim of the department is to provide quality education where interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary teaching and research in botany has established, and student centered activities. It is a department where the local knowledge, originality, creativity and motivations are considered more than conventional methods in teaching and producing well-trained students who are more capable to meet the challenges in the current scenario. The department always encourages the students for their higher studies and research field by recognizing the student’s individual potentiality. The students after completion of the course are leaving the portals of the department with great confidence in the competitive world. The subject offers students in many activities during their course like classroom learning, hands on training in various practicals, preparation of herbaria, outstation excursions, field exploration studies, minor research projects, etc. The students can learn the biology, interrelationships and behavior of various kinds of organisms from microbial diversity to higher plants, internal structures, pollination mechanisms, various modes of dispersals, various biochemical reactions in plants, invasives and responses to environmental factors, and biodiversity conservation. </p>
