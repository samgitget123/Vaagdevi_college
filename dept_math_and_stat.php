            <h4>Vision of Maths Department</h4>
            <p> <b>-></b> 	To achieve high standards of excellence in generating and propagating knowledge in Mathematics. Department is committed in providing an education that combines rigorous academics with joy of discovery.<br>
<b>-></b>	To provide an environment where students can learn, become competent users of mathematics,        and understand the use of mathematics in other disciplines.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-5 ">Mission of Maths Department</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>	To provide excellent knowledge of Mathematical sciences for suitable career and groom them for national recognition. </li>
<li>	Moreover, the department will contribute to the development of students as mathematical thinkers, enabling them to become lifelong learners, to continue to grow in their chosen professions, and to function as productive citizens.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-5 ">Vision and Mission of Statistics</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>	The mission of the statistics is to provide excellent training in scientific data collection, data management, methods and procedures of data analysis.</li>
<li>	The philosophy is to concentrate learning and training activities on the art of probabilistic reasoning, i.e., the logic and principles that should guide rational decision making under conditions of limited information and uncertainty. This philosophy equips our students with skills that all employers consider desirable. </li>
