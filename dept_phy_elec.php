<p>STUDENT ACHIEVEMENTS </p>
<ul><li>	Our PG/UG students actively participated  in the state level MEET VaagVismai , National Science Day and  Science fair.</li>
<li>	In the last academic year one of our PG student Thatipelli Harika participated in Seminar presentation in LB College on the eve of National Science Day-2020 and awarded with second prize.</li>
<li>	Many of the students from UG/PG showed creative skills during the period of Vinayaka Navaratri Utsav by making Lord Ganesh on Chandrayaan EXHIBIT using waste  materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, two of our Alumni students joined as scientists in ONGC</p>
<p>Rajamahendravaram and BDL in Machlipatnam.</p>
<h4>RESEARCH ACTIVITIES</h4>
<ul><li>	The scope of the research activity in the subject of physics (i.e., Experimental Techniques) is very less in our state . Though, we are pursuing continuously  research activity with available sources.</li>
<li>	I published the research papers with the help of my guide Prof. A.S. Nageshwar Rao (Retired) from the department of Physics K.U. </li>
<li>	Attanuation coefficient of fatty acids in the Gamma ray energy range 130keV – 160keV ( Pramana - 2018)</li>
