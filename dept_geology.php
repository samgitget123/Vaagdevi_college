          <span> DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY </span> 
            </h4>
            <p>The Department possesses a three-year (6 semesters) course in combination with life science branches such as Botany and Zoology in the college. The department is having high quality teaching and moderately equipped, and has a display of different types of rocks, minerals and fossils collected from different regions of Telangana in the department. The students learn about rocks formation, various types of rocks, lava, petrology, minerals, metamorphism, polymorphism, hydrogeology, silicates, slates, quartz, ecologites and microscopes. The young department is encouraged by the management in various activities like seminars, workshops to explore the knowledge and current trends in geological aspects.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-3">FIELD STUDY & PRACTICAL WORK</h4>
            <p>Field trips and practical work are mandatory to the students to understand about the formation of rocks, types of minerals, fossil types. Every year, the department conducts the field trips to students under the guidance of experienced faculty to nearby areas like Godavari basin to study rocks formation, Mahadevpur, Eturnagaram and Pakhal forest regions to aware about fossil types. During the field trips, the students can understand the formation and locate the fossils and rocks sites, collect the different types of materials and deposit them in the department laboratory</p>
            <h4 class="mt-3">CHOICE OF PROGRAMME</h4>
            <p>Though the department is a young bud, it is trying to produce enthusiastic students who are well trained in the identification various types of fossils, minerals and rocks which pave the way to enter the leading geological organizations of India such as GSI, MECL, NMDC, ONGC, etc. and also in teaching at national level.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-3">EVENTS & ACTIVITIES</h4>
            <p>The faculty of the department is highly active and encourages the students to attend various events such as seminars/conferences, or workshops conduct by the Department of Geology, Kakatiya University or other institutions in Telangana State.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-3">CAREER PROSPECTS</h4>
            <p>Now-a-days, the Geology is a very important subject and increasing topical importance to it. The well-trained students can engage in the wastewater treatment, disposal of waste, urban development, groundwater management, environmental planning, water pollution, landscaping and these students are observational elements in analysis of palaeontology, sedimentology and structural geology.</p>
