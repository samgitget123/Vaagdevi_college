            <h6>About Department:</h6>
            <p>Like medicine, microbiology is not a single subject, but rather an umbrella, which offers a range of specializations. Microbiology has spawned a plethora of jobs in wide spectrum of industries from pharmacy to cosmetics. It is a department where the local knowledge, originality, creativity and motivations are considered more than conventional methods in teaching and producing well-trained students who are more capable to meet the challenges in the current scenario. The department always encourages the students for their higher studies and research field by recognizing the student’s individual potentiality. The students after completion of the course are leaving the portals of the department with great confidence in the competitive world. The subject offers students in many activities during their course like classroom learning, hands on training in various practical’s , preparation of herbaria, outstation excursions, field exploration studies, minor research projects, etc. The students can learn the biology, interrelationships and behaviour of various kinds of organisms from microbial diversity ,agriculture related organisms which help in </p>
